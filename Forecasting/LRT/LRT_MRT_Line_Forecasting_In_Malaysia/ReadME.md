This forecasting project is done for four major LRT & MRT Lines in Malaysia which are LRT Kelana Jaya Line, MRT Kajang Line, LRT Ampang Line and MRT Putrajaya Line.

This forecasting project was done in January 2026.

The forecast period done is for Q1 of 2026 (January 2026 to March 2026) and the time-series model used for this forecasting is Prophet. 

In this particular project, the aspects that I have covered include: 
  
  i) Analysis of yearly volume for each of the line
  
  ii) Analysis of monthly volume for each of the lines for each year from the year of 2019 to 2025 (Comparison between each of the lines for       each specific year).
  
  iii) Analysis of monthly volume for each of the lines combined from the year of 2019 to 2025 (Comparison between each of the year for             specific lines separately). 
  
  iv) Running of Prophet model for the training data. Each line has a different duration of training data taken for this Prophet model. 
  
  v) Analysis of actual, predicted, APE, MAE and MAPE values for each of this line for the testing data. 

Soon, I will create the full documentation for this project.
